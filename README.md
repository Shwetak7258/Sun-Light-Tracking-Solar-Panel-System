# Sunlight Tracking Solar Panel System

## Project Overview
This project presents a sunlight tracking solar panel system designed to maximize the energy generation efficiency of solar panels. By integrating an Arduino Uno, Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs), and a servo motor, the system automatically adjusts the solar panel's orientation to follow the sun throughout the day, ensuring optimal sunlight exposure. The proposed system is cost-effective, energy-efficient, and suitable for residential or small-scale solar power setups.

## Features
- **Sun Tracking**: The system uses two LDR sensors to detect sunlight intensity and adjusts the panel's position using a servo motor.
- **Arduino Integration**: The Arduino Uno microcontroller processes LDR sensor data to control the servo motor for precise sun tracking.
- **Improved Energy Efficiency**: Compared to fixed-panel systems, this design increases energy output by 25-35%.
- **Low-Cost Design**: The system uses simple components like a 3V solar panel, Arduino Uno, two LDR sensors, and a servo motor, making it affordable and accessible for residential use.

## Hardware Requirements
- **Arduino Uno**: The microcontroller used to process sensor data and control the servo motor.
- **LDR Sensors (2)**: Light Dependent Resistors used to detect sunlight intensity on both sides of the solar panel.
- **Servo Motor**: Controls the rotation of the solar panel based on the processed LDR data.
- **3V Solar Panel**: Collects solar energy and provides electrical output.
- **Jumper Wires**: Used to make connections between various components.

## Software Requirements
- **Arduino IDE**: Software platform used to write, compile, and upload the code to the Arduino board.

## How It Works
1. **Sensor Detection**: Two LDR sensors are placed at opposite ends of the solar panel. These sensors detect the intensity of sunlight falling on them.
2. **Microcontroller Logic**: The Arduino reads the sensor data, compares the intensity of the sunlight, and determines which direction the panel should move to maximize sunlight exposure.
3. **Servo Motor Adjustment**: Based on the data from the LDR sensors, the Arduino sends signals to the servo motor to adjust the position of the solar panel accordingly.
4. **Energy Generation**: As the panel follows the sun, it maintains an optimal angle, maximizing solar energy capture and increasing energy generation efficiency.

## Results
- **Energy Generation Efficiency**: The tracking system increases energy output by 25-35% compared to a fixed-panel system.
- **Performance in Different Conditions**: The system adapts to seasonal variations, ensuring optimal panel alignment in both summer and winter.
- **Power Consumption**: While the tracking mechanism consumes some energy for the motors, the net gain from increased solar capture outweighs the consumption.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Higher Energy Yield**: With sun tracking, the system consistently generates more energy than fixed-panel setups.
- **Optimized Solar Capture**: The system ensures that the panel is always oriented towards the sun, capturing maximum light throughout the day.

## Installation
1. Connect the LDR sensors to the Arduino Uno's analog input pins.
2. Attach the servo motor to the Arduino using PWM pins for control.
3. Mount the solar panel onto the servo motor's movable base.
4. Upload the Arduino code using the Arduino IDE.
5. Power the system with a suitable power supply for the Arduino and servo motor.

## Code Overview
The code for the system uses basic conditional logic to compare the sunlight intensity readings from the two LDR sensors. Based on the comparison, the servo motor is activated to rotate the solar panel towards the brighter side.

## Applications
- **Residential Use**: Ideal for small-scale solar energy systems, particularly in homes with low power needs.
- **Off-Grid Energy**: Suitable for off-grid locations where maximizing solar energy capture is crucial for consistent energy supply.

## Future Improvements
- **Dual-Axis Tracking**: Implementing dual-axis tracking to follow the sun more precisely.
- **Battery Integration**: Combining the system with battery storage for energy backup during low-sunlight periods.
- **AI Integration**: Enhancing tracking algorithms using AI for more precise control and weather-based adjustments.
